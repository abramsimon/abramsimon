Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for taking the time to check me out. Iâ€™m a hands-on engineering leader that enjoys building teams as much as building things. Throughout my 20 years of software engineering Iâ€™ve had the privilege to work with some amazingly talented people and have worked tirelessly to absorb their wisdom and build on the lessons they taught. 

The most rewarding of these opportunities (at Bidtellect) allowed me to not only architect a system that scaled to 100k transactions/second with < 50ms latency (p95), but also to cultivate an engineering culture that was fun, energetic, and rewarding for everyone involved.
